Visit [here](http://zichenjiang.me/GlossGallery/) to view the gallery.

This is a gallery that holds the gloss examples made by students from McMaster who were in CompSci 1JC3 in 2013 fall.
The course is taught by [Dr. Anand](http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~anand/). The gallery is built upon the request of the professor.

The gallery is mobile-friendly, not very IE-friendly though.

The gallery will be updated every year around December when the top animations of the class are selected.

Please send issues to this repository regarding anything such as spelling mistakes of your name or project, modification of description of your project, etc.
If you have a personal website that you want to link to your name in the gallery, please do send issues too.
