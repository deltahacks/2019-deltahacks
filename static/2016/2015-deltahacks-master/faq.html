                    <p>
                    deltaHacks is the first student-run Canadian Hackathon for Change. We’ll be pairing students with non-profit mentors to tackle real problems. The focus of this hackathon is to encourage students to combine programming knowledge with the intent to make something that has a positive impact on the world. Students will have 24 hours to make their awesome ideas come to life.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What’s a hackathon?</h3>
                    <p>
                    A hackathon is a creative coding marathon. Students are encouraged to come with an idea, form teams, and then build out that idea into a product in 24 hours. For deltaHacks, we want you to use your knowledge and hack for change. This could be a web app, hardware gizmo and etc. It is a great time to push the envelope and learn some new skills. The sky’s the limit.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How much will deltaHacks cost me?</h3>
                    <p>
                    deltaHacks is completely free to attend! We’ll also be feeding you for the entire event. Plus lots of snacks, swag and a great experience.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Who can participate?</h3>
                    <p>
                    The event is completely free for any University/College student. You don’t have to attend McMaster University.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Guidelines</h3>
                    <p>
                    Don’t use an old project, start something new instead! Obviously, alcohol, drugs, firearms, knives, weapons (including toys) are strictly forbidden. Read through our Code of Conduct for more details.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What if I’m new to all of this?</h3>
                    <p>
                    No worries. It’s definitely a plus to have prior coding or technical experience, but it’s not a requirement. We’ll have talks, mentors and workshops to help you with your project- Hackathons can be a great place to learn new skills in a short amount of time. Just come eager to learn, excited to meet lots of awesome people and most importantly, come ready to build.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Is there travel reimbursement?</h3>
                    <p>
                    At this time we unfortunately cannot offer travel reimbursement. We also won't be doing buses from other schools. But you're more than welcome to get here however you like (public transit, sled, canoe).
                    </p>

                    <h3>What about food?</h3>
                    <p>
                    We’ll be providing you with breakfast, lunch, and dinner as well as frequent snacks all completely free of charge.
                    </p>

                    <h3>I don’t have a team or an idea!</h3>
                    <p>
                    Don't worry! We will be providing students many opportunities to connect with each other at the event to form teams. We’ll also be hosting workshops and talks to help with brainstorming.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How many people can be on my team?</h3>
                    <p>
                    Up to four people can be on a single team and your teammates do not have to come from the same university as you. Working solo is fine too, but hackathons are more fun when you work together!
                    </p>

                    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                    <p>
                    A laptop, cables/chargers and your student card are the essentials. If you have a hardware hack in mind, bring along the needed components too! You can also bring your sleeping bag and toiletries.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Can I start working on my project before the hackathon starts?</h3>
                    <p>
                    No. To be fair to everyone, students should not be working on their projects before deltaHack begins and we do not encourage participants to work on pre-existing projects; feel free to use third-party APIs and libraries though. If you really can’t wait and are just itching to get started, you can prepare by familiarizing yourself with the specific tools or technologies you intend to use in your project.
                    </p>
