# DELTAHACKS IV WEBSITE

### Installation and Startup
The DH4 website consists of a react web app. To start off make sure you have node package manager and the following packages installed on your machine :

- npm-run-all
- react-scripts
- node-sass-chokidar
- gh-pages

and then run

	npm install
Once it's done installing packages run

    npm start

You should now have a local development server on localhost:3000. Here you can edit files, save them, and then reload your browser to see the updated results. Currently SASS, a css processor, is being used for styling and ES6 guides are being used to create the DH4 site. 

### Folder Breakdown

/public contains the index.html file that gets built and minified.
/src contains the actual react app and css (*EDIT THIS*)
/src/img contains all the images used
/src/fonts contains all the fonts used
/src/App.scss contains all the styling via tags and classNames (*Don't use ids*)
/src/App.css gets rebuilt on every change so your changes to that will be replaced with the SASS file
/src/App.jsx contains the entire app for now and will get updated when there is more content to contain different components.

### Publishing

    npm run deploy 
    
Creates a minified project that is able to run packages without a server and places the files in a gh-pages branch. You can then copy those files and overwrite the current index.html in the main master branch folder which will update the deltahacks.com page. 

User / Organization pages live in a specially named repository called username.github.io, and publish from the master branch. They can be browsed at http://username.github.io.

Project pages can be part of any repository, and are published from the special gh-pages branch. They can be browsed at http://username.github.io/project-name.

Thus, our final minified project needs to be stored on the master branch.

### Cleanup 

The DH2 and DH3 folders have been archived in 2016 and 2017 respectively. They can be transferred to a new branch afterwards to clean up the master.
